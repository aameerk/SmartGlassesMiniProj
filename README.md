Smart Glasses using Internet of things.

### Abstract:
People experiencing visual disabilities and visual impairment experience difficulties moving freely
and defeating different issues in their standard lives. In order to overcome this problem we have
implemented Smart glasses with object detection and natural language processing (NLP) is an
emerging technology that combines the power of computer vision and language processing that
help user interacting with their surroundings. These glasses are equipped with a small camera that
can detect objects and allowing users to receive real-time information about the objects they see.
Future works may focus on optimizing the system's speed, as well as exploring additional use
cases for this technologies such as hand gestures, Emergency alert etc.
